  <p style="margin-top:40px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_as_food#Edible_components" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Chicken Breast</a> : These are white meat and are relatively dry. The breast has two segments which are sold together on bone-in breasts, but separated on boneless breasts:</p>
  <p>1.The "breast", when sold as boneless, and</p>
  <p>2.two "tenderloin", located on each side between the breast meat and the ribs. These are removed from boneless breasts and sold separately as tenderloins.</p>
  <p>Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.</p>
